# Procedural-generator-for-exteriors-of-Stockholmstyle-buildings
This project aims to develop a procedural generator for exteriors (building facades) of Stockholm-style buildings.

The creation of compelling models is a crucial task in the development of successful movies and computer games. However, modeling complex three-dimensional elements, such as buildings, is a very expensive process and can require several man-years worth of labor.
A solution to this can either be
to reuse content throughout the world or to utilize procedural-generated content.

The main advantages of procedural generation are to avoid the repetition given by reused content, allow for more realistic scenarios and also give the possibility to generate personalized environments. On the other side, the drawbacks of this technology are the increased computational complexity and the risk of generating non-realistic or non-plausible structures.
